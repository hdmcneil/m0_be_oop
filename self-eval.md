# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

The last two sections I was having a couple of problems. First, when I was getting errors back in the terminal I would then go back and overcomplicate things. Second, I missed putting `end` in the correct space. Third, I was trying to do it all from memory and was missing simple things like quotes or commas. I reviewed syntax, slowed down, and reference my notes more. I felt like this helped me a lot when doing this assignment.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Good.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

Stop freaking out.
